- ðŸ’¥[Feature] Switch from the legacy `cs_comments_service` Ruby app to the new forum v2 Python app. In addition, forum data is now stored in MySQL, and not in MongoDb. This considerably simplifies this plugin. Change should be transparent for most users, unless the forum backend has been customised in some way. (by @regisb)
